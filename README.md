# CalCOFI
Univariate Linear Regression Analysis
(Based on teachings from Professor Andrew Ng!)

Problems:
Find the optimal parameters to model the linear relationship between salinity (input) and water temperature (output)
Formulate a hypothesis and predict water temperature given salinity.

Based on oceanographic data from over 60 years, collected from The California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations 
(CalCOFI) are a unique partnership of the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, NOAA Fisheries Service and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 

Note: Based on lectures up to linear regression, does not include statistical analysis to validate or determine correlation between water salinity and water temperature.
Assume that the data follows a linear regression
Most of the data has been removed for the purposes of this exercise (to reduce the computing load on my laptop), 1st column = Temperature, 2nd column = Salinity
